# 50 Projects in 50 Days: Password Generator

This project was created by following the Udemy tutorial: [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?couponCode=24T3MT53024).

## Description

This project generates a password that can be copied to a clipboard.

I updated this project to randomize the characters used in the password. I used the 'Knuth Shuffle' method.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to give credit to instructors [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/) and [Florin Pop](https://www.udemy.com/user/popflorin/)  for the excellent tutorial. The course provided invaluable insights and guidance throughout the project.
